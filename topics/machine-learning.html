        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It's the foundation of technologies like recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and speech recognition.

        <p>
          There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Each uses different methods to analyze data and make predictions or decisions. From spam filters to fraud detection, machine learning is transforming industries by automating and optimizing complex tasks.
